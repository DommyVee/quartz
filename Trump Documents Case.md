2. **Background**:
    
    - **Mar-a-Lago** is the private club and residence of former President [Donald Trump](Donald%20Trump.md) in Palm Beach, Florida.
    - In August 2022, federal agents raided Mar-a-Lago, seizing boxes of documents they believed contained illegally retained classified materials.
3. **The Box Journey**:
    
    - One box in particular caught attention during the investigation.
    - An employee was assigned to scan this box, which contained records of someone’s schedule (unclear whose).
    - Initially kept under the desk of Person 34 at Mar-a-Lago, it was eventually moved to the tennis cottage for scanning.
    - Scanned documents made their way to Person 10’s laptop.
    - The box then sat untouched in a Trump office until late August to September 2022 when employees returned to Mar-a-Lago.
    - It came full circle, back under Person 34’s desk.
4. **Key Points**:
    
    - The case involves allegations of illegally retained classified documents.
    - The investigation sheds light on the inner workings of Mar-a-Lago, once dubbed the “Winter White House.”
    - The government released a less-redacted version of the search warrant affidavit in August 2023.
